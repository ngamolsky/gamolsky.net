                A creative problem solver and experienced software engineer

                I have expertise in full stack development ranging from customer
                research, to design and implementation across the front and back
                end.

            <p>
              With considerable experience in mission-driven startups, I'm now
              looking to transition to a founding engineering role at an early
              stage climate tech startup.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I'd love for the opportunity to meet founders in the space to hear
              their stories and to see if there is potential for a partnership!
            </p>

              I'm also open to freelance work and consulting work, so if you
